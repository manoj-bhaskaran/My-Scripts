google_drive_root_files_delete.py

Deletes all non-folder files in the root directory of a Google Drive account using the Google Drive API.
Utilizes multithreading to speed up the deletion process and logs progress and errors.

Dependencies:
    - googleapiclient
    - google_drive_auth (custom authentication module)
    - tqdm
    - python_logging_framework (custom logging module)
    - concurrent.futures
    - threading
    - datetime
    - time

Usage:
    python google_drive_root_files_delete.py

Notes:
    - Ensure that authentication credentials are set up via google_drive_auth.
    - The script will log progress and errors to a log file (auto-named).
    - All non-folder files in the root of the authenticated user's Google Drive will be deleted.
