# Videoscreenshot Module – Changelog

All notable changes to the **PowerShell Videoscreenshot module** are documented here.  
The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and the structure is inspired by
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

> This file is module-scoped. For repository-wide changes affecting other scripts, see the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-10-14
### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C handling compatibility**: Fixed `CancelKeyPress` error in PowerShell hosts where the Console.CancelKeyPress event is not available (VS Code integrated terminal, PowerShell ISE, remote sessions). The function now gracefully falls back when Ctrl+C handling is unavailable, allowing the cropper to run normally in all environments.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-09-14
### Breaking
- Decommission `src\powershell\videoscreenshot.ps1`. Invoking it now prints guidance to use `Start-VideoBatch` and exits with a non-zero code.

### Docs
- Update README to remove “legacy wrapper (still supported)” examples and clearly direct users to import the module and call `Start-VideoBatch`.
- Directory layout updated to mark the wrapper as decommissioned.

## [2.x] — 2025-09-07 → 2025-09-14 (consolidated)

### Breaking
- **PowerShell 7+ required** (2.0.0). Module targets PSEdition Core (pwsh) and errors on Windows PowerShell 5.1 with clear migration guidance.

### Added
- **Re-cropping controls** (2.5.0): `-ReprocessCropped` and `-KeepExistingCrops` to force re-crop and optionally retain existing outputs.
- **Crop-only mode** (2.3.0): Run the Python cropper over `-SaveFolder` without taking screenshots.
- **Python module fallback** (2.4.0): If `-PythonScriptPath` is omitted, run `python -m crop_colours` (PYTHONPATH / installed package support).
- **Batch/validation options** (2.1.x): `-VerifyVideos` (when `Test-VideoPlayable` exists) and `-IncludeExtensions` to override discovery; logging switches (`Write-Message -Quiet`, `-LogFile`).
- **Processed-log compatibility** (2.2.0): Accept both legacy single-column and TSV (`<Path>\t<Status>[\t<Reason>]`) formats.

### Changed
- **Default reprocessing behavior** (2.5.0): Skip previously cropped images by default (no longer passes `--ignore-processed` to Python).
- **Crop-only requirements** (2.4.0): `-SaveFolder` is now mandatory; capture flags are ignored with a single warning.
- **Live output** (2.4.1–2.4.2): Cropper stdout/stderr stream directly to the console (no buffering). Result still returns `ExitCode`/`ElapsedSeconds`.

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C / cancellation** (2.4.2–2.4.3): Forward console cancel to Python cropper; promptly return control to PowerShell. Handler is scoped and removed after use.
- **Runspace crash** (2.2.1+): Removed background per-line handlers around VLC startup to avoid “There is no Runspace available…”; replaced with a safer watchdog.
- **Misc. robustness** (2.2.x): Eliminate stray pipeline output (`True`), correct return shapes, prevent nested arg arrays, make TRACE null-safe, and normalize resume sets.

### Orchestration & I/O
- **VLC/GDI** (2.1.x–2.2.x): Validated inputs; ordered and logged VLC args; safer monitor selection; retry-on-save; clearer stderr capture on failure.
- **Resume & processed** (2.2.x): Robust index builder, absolute-path normalization, tolerant of malformed lines.
- **I/O helpers** (2.1.x): `Test-FolderWritable -SkipCreate`, `Add-ContentWithRetry` with retry/flush.

### Documentation
- README expanded for crop-only usage, processed-log formats, re-cropping semantics, Python module invocation, troubleshooting (incl. GDI tips), and performance guidance.

### Notes
- Cropper output always streams to the console; **Ctrl+C** cancels cleanly in both `-RunCropper` and `-CropOnly`.
- If you need more granular details per change, see the corresponding git commit messages between 2.0.0 and 2.5.0.

## [1.x] – 2024–2025 (condensed)

> Consolidated highlights for all **1.*** releases.  
> **For omissions or more granular details, please refer to the corresponding git commit messages (tags `v1.x.y`) in the repository history.**

### Added
- **Modularization (1.3.0):** Split the monolithic script into a PowerShell module with `Public/` and `Private/` components; introduced `Start-VideoBatch` as the public entrypoint and kept the legacy wrapper for back-compat.
- **Per-run context:** `New-VideoRunContext` centralizes version, config, stats, and run GUID; helpers accept `-Context`.
- **Config defaults:** `Get-DefaultConfig` provides central, immutable defaults (timings, extensions).
- **PID registry:** Helpers to track VLC child processes across the run.
- **Structured logging:** Timestamped `Write-Message` with stream routing.
- **Snapshot + GDI paths:** VLC scene-snapshot mode and Windows GDI+ desktop capture.
- **Processed/resume support (early iterations):** Helpers to track processed items and resume runs.
- **Cropper integration (1.2.x):** First Python cropper wiring with live output forwarding; interpreter resolution and preflight.

### Changed
- **Deterministic loader (1.3.6):** Dot-sources `Public/` and `Private/` in sorted order; warns when folders are missing.
- **Argument handling & orchestration:** Fixed edge cases in VLC arg builders; clarified argument array returns; consistent success-or-throw contract across helpers.
- **Post-capture reporting (1.3.3):** Consumes `snapStats`/`gdiStats` for frame deltas and achieved FPS; falls back to disk counts when needed.
- **Outcome consistency (1.3.2+):** Unified error-handling patterns; eliminated mixed bool/null conventions; ensured process stderr is surfaced on startup failures.

### Fixed
- **File I/O reliability (1.3.1–1.3.2):** `Add-ContentWithRetry` disposes handles via `finally`; clearer final-failure behavior; avoids stale locks.
- **VLC arg array bugs (1.3.1):** Removed stray commas and ensured arrays are returned correctly to prevent parsing/quoting errors.
- **Stability & guards:** Snapshot-mode guardrails; safer GDI capture initialization; early checks for required tools.

### Documentation
- **README (1.x series):** Introduced module structure, migration notes, and usage examples; documented PowerShell 7+ requirement and basic troubleshooting.
- **Inline help/comments:** Incremental comment-based help across new module files; expanded inline comments in orchestrators and helpers.

### Notes
- **Compatibility:** 1.* focused on modularization, reliability, and clarity without breaking the legacy wrapper.
- **Scope:** Some later capabilities (e.g., richer FPS detection, config-aware VLC orchestration, auto-install cropper deps) arrived in 2.* and are not part of 1.*.
