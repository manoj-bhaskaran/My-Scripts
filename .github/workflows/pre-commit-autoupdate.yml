            ## Pre-Commit Hook Updates

            - Updated hook versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

            **Testing:**
            - Pre-commit hooks will run automatically in CI
            - Review the changes and verify all hooks pass

            **Merging:**
            - This PR can be safely merged if all CI checks pass
            - The pre-commit hooks are non-breaking and follow semantic versioning
