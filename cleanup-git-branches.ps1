.SYNOPSIS
    Identifies and deletes obsolete (fully merged) local Git branches and their corresponding remote branches.
    
    Supports dry-run mode, customizable remote names, exclusion lists, retention of recently merged branches,
    and the ability to operate from a specified Git repository root without altering the user's current working location.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the cleanup of local Git branches that have already been merged into the current branch,
    and optionally deletes the corresponding remote branches. It supports:
    - Dry-run mode to simulate cleanup without making changes.
    - Customizable remote names (e.g., origin, upstream).
    - An exclusion list of branches that should never be deleted.
    - A retention policy to preserve a specified number of recently merged branches.
    - Operation from a specified Git repository directory, restoring the user's original location on completion.

.PARAMETER RemoteName
    The name of the remote repository. Default is 'origin'.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    If specified, the script will only display what would be deleted without performing actual deletions.

.PARAMETER ExcludeBranches
    An array of branch names to exclude from deletion (e.g., 'main', 'master', 'develop').

.PARAMETER WorkingDirectory
    The path to the root directory of a Git repository to operate in. If specified, the script temporarily switches
    to that directory for execution and returns to the original location afterward.

.PARAMETER KeepRecent
    The number of most recently active merged branches to retain (based on latest commit time). Default is 10.

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1 -RemoteName upstream -DryRun -ExcludeBranches "main","develop"

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1 -WorkingDirectory "D:\Projects\myrepo" -DryRun

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1 -KeepRecent 5
