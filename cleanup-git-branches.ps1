.SYNOPSIS
    Identifies and deletes obsolete (fully merged) local Git branches and their corresponding remote branches.
    
    Supports dry-run mode, customizable remote names and exclusion lists, and the ability to operate from a specified
    Git repository root directory without altering the user's current working location.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the cleanup of local Git branches that have already been merged into the current branch,
    and optionally deletes the corresponding remote branches. It supports a dry-run mode, customizable remote names,
    and an exclusion list of branches that should never be deleted. The script can also be run against a specified
    Git repository path without requiring the user to be in that directory.

.PARAMETER RemoteName
    The name of the remote repository. Default is 'origin'.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    If specified, the script will only display what would be deleted without performing actual deletions.

.PARAMETER ExcludeBranches
    An array of branch names to exclude from deletion (e.g., 'main', 'master', 'develop').

.PARAMETER WorkingDirectory
    The path to the root directory of a Git repository to operate in. If specified, the script temporarily switches
    to that directory for execution and returns to the original location afterward.

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1 -RemoteName upstream -DryRun -ExcludeBranches "main","develop"

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-git-branches.ps1 -WorkingDirectory "D:\Projects\myrepo" -DryRun
